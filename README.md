Welcome!

This repository contains some "pure" FPGA examples for the Hackady Supercon 2019 FPGA badge.

This examples don't use any of the wonderful and powerful SOC that Sprite\_tm developed, they are meant to show off a little bit what you can do with just the raw FPGA.

If you are looking for the hadbadge2019 SOC go here: https://github.com/spritetm/hadbadge2019_fpgasoc

I hope you have fun!
